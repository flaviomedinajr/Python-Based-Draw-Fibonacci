# Python-Based-Fibonacci

- Python-Based-Fibonacci is a Python program that explores and visualizes the famous Fibonacci sequence through recursion, array manipulation, and colorful turtle graphics.


It includes:

- Recursive generation of Fibonacci numbers

- Automatic filling of arrays with Fibonacci terms

- Ratio analysis between terms (approaching the golden ratio)

- Drawing a colorful Fibonacci spiral using turtle graphics



This project demonstrates how Python can be used for:

- Mathematical computation (recursion, sequences)

- Algorithm design (array filling, error handling)

- Data visualization (drawing with turtle)

- Creative coding (combining math and art visually)
